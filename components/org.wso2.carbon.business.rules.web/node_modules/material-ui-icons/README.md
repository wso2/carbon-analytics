# material-ui-icons

This package provides the Google [Material icons](https://material.io/icons/) packaged as a set of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components.
These components replace the `svg-icons` included in
 0.x.x releases of [Material-UI](http://material-ui.com).

## Installation

Install the package in your project directory with:

```
npm i -S material-ui-icons
```

These components use the Material-UI [SvgIcon](http://material-ui.com/#/style/icons) component to
render the SVG path for each icon, and so a have a peer-dependency on the `next` release of Material-UI.

If you are not already using Material-UI in your project, you can add it with:

```
npm i -S material-ui@next
```

## Usage

The import path for each Material icon component includes the icon name in PascalCase.

For example to use the 'access alarm' icon component, import `material-ui-icons/AccessAlarm`.

Note: One exception is '3d rotation', which is named `ThreeDRotation`.

### Examples

- If your environment doesn't support tree-shaking, the **recommended** way to import the icons is the following:
```jsx
import AccessAlarmIcon from 'material-ui-icons/AccessAlarm';
import ThreeDRotation from 'material-ui-icons/ThreeDRotation';
```

- If your environment support tree-shaking you can also import the icons that way:
```jsx
import { AccessAlarm, ThreeDRotation } from 'material-ui-icons';
```

Note: Importing named exports in this way will result in the code for *every icon* being included in your project, so is not recommended unless you configure [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading an existing project from Material-UI 0.x.x, you will need to revise the import paths
from `material-ui/svg-icons/<category>/<icon-name>` to `material-ui-icons/<IconName>`.

We may provide a [codemod](https://github.com/facebook/codemod) in a future release.
