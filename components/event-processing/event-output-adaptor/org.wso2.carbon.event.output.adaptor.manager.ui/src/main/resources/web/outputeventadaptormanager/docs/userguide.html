<h2>Configuring WSO2Event Output Event Adaptor</h2>


<p>WSO2Event output event adaptor handles WSO2 common events and is used to publish events over
   Thrift using TCP, SSL, HTTP, and HTTPS. You can send output events to any other WSO2Event server
   from the CEP, using Thrift over TCP, SSL, HTTP, or HTTPS.</p>

<p>The steps below explain how to configure using the management console or using an XML file in
   step 5.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to the CEP management console, select the <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> <strong>Output
                                                                                                   Event
                                                                                                   Adaptors</strong> menu and then click <strong>Add
                                                                                                                                                 Output
                                                                                                                                                 Event
                                                                                                                                                 Adaptor</strong>.</span> </span>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Enter details in the form that appears and click<strong> Add Event Adaptor</strong> button
        at the end of the form. For example,<br/>
        <img src="../images/AddOutputWSO2EventAdaptor.png" alt="Create Event Adaptor"/>
        <br/>Following values are used in the configuration above:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Event Adaptor Name : outputWSO2EventAdaptor</li>
            <li>Event Adaptor Type : wso2event</li>
            <li>Receiver URL : <a>tcp://localhost:7611</a> (In this example, we assumes that the
                Agent Server is started on port 7611)
            </li>
            <li>Authenticator URL : <a>ssl://localhost:7711</a>
            </li>
            <li>User Name/Password : admin/admin</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>After a adapter is successfully added, you can change its configuration and redeploy it. To
        do this, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link associated with it. You can also click the
        other links associated with it to delete it or enable statistics and tracing.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>An XML based editor opens allowing you to edit the event adaptor configuration from UI
        itself, without having to edit the file in the file system. <span>Do your modifications and <strong>Update</strong>.</span>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>you can specify a event adaptor configuration using an XML file and save it in <code>&lt;PRODUCT_HOME&gt;/repository/deployment/server/outputeventadaptors </code>directory,
        which is the output event adaptor deployment directory. Since hot deployment is enabled, you
        can simply add/remove files to deploy/undeploy from the server.</span> </span>
        <p>Create the XML file with the following WSO2Event event adaptor configurations. Output
           event adaptor implementation must start with <code>&lt;outputEventAdaptor&gt;</code> root
           element.</p> <br/>
        <br/><pre>&lt;outputEventAdaptor name="outputWSO2EventAdaptor" statistics="disable"
                                                             trace="disable" type="wso2event" xmlns="http://wso2.org/carbon/eventadaptormanager"&gt;
                &lt;property name="username"&gt;admin&lt;/property&gt;
                &lt;property name="receiverURL"&gt;tcp://localhost:7661&lt;/property&gt;
                &lt;property name="password"&gt;admin&lt;/property>
                &lt;property name="authenticatorURL"&gt;ssl://localhost:7761&lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;/outputEventAdaptor&gt;</pre>
        <br/>
    </li>
    <br/>
</ol>
