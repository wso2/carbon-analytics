<h1>Execution Plan</h1>

<h2>Configuring Execution plan</h2>

<p>You can configure execution plans through the management console as explained below or by
   manually adding an XML file as explained in step 5.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://docs.wso2.org/display/CEP300/Running+the+Product">Start the CEP</a>, log in
                                                                                           to its
                                                                                           management
                                                                                           console,
                                                                                           select
        <strong>Execution
                Plans</strong>
                                                                                           and click<strong>
        Add </strong> <strong>Execution Plan</strong>.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Enter details in the form that appears and click the<strong> Add Execution Plan</strong>
        button at the end of the form. For example,<br/>
        <br/><img src="../images/event-details.png" alt="Event details"/>
        <br/>The fields in the above configuration are described below:<br/> <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Execution Plan Name : Can contain only alphanumeric characters and '_' character
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Description : This is optional</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Snapshot time interval : Defines how often the state of the processing engine should
                be persisted, which is used to restore after a system crash. The default value is 0,
                which disables this feature. If snapshot is enabled, you must start the CEP with the
                embedded Cassandra server enabled. To do this, specify <strong>-Ddisable.cassandra.server.startup=false </strong>
                option at server startup.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Query expressions: See Siddhi Language Specification documentation on how to write
                queries. When writing query expressions, you must import the required streams from
                event builders. The <strong>As</strong> field maps the incoming stream to a stream
                name suitable for the Siddhi processing engine. It can contain only alphanumeric
                characters and '_' character.<br/> <br/>In the text field that follows imported
                streams, you can enter any number of CEP statements, each ending with a semicolon.
                For example,<br/>
                <br/><img src="../images/query-expressions.png" alt="Query Expressions"/><br/>
                The <strong>Exported streams</strong> section allows you to expose the output
                streams from Siddhi to the event formatter with preferred stream IDs. For
                example,<br/>
                <br/><img src="../images/exported-streams.png" alt="Exported Streams"/><br/>
                <br/>For the <strong>StreamId</strong>, provide a character string that starts with
                an alphabetic because it is considered as a java variable in Siddhi. Stream Id is a
                combination of stream name and version. E.g., <a>testStream:1.0.0</a>.
            </li>
            <br/>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After an execution plan is successfully created, you can change its configuration and
        redeploy it. To do this, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link associated with it.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>An XML based editor opens allowing you to edit the event builder configuration from the UI
        itself, without having to edit the file in the file system. Do your modifications and click
        <strong>Update</strong>.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
        <p>Alternatively, you can specify an execution plan configuration using an XML file and save
           it in <code>&lt;PRODUCT_HOME&gt;/repository/deployment/server/executionplans</code>
           directory, which is the execution plan deployment directory. Since hot deployment is
           enabled, you can simply add/remove files to deploy/undeploy from the server.<br/> <br/>Create
           the XML file with the following XML based configurations. Execution plan implementation
           must start with <code>&lt;executionplan&gt;</code> root element as in the example
           below:<br/>
            <br/><img src="../images/execution-plan-filesystem-edit.png"
                      alt="Exported Streams"/><br/>
        </p>
    </li>
    <br/>
</ol>

   documentation <a
